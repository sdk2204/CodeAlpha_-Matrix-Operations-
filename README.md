# CodeAlpha Task 2 — Matrix Operations in C

This project is part of the CodeAlpha C Programming Internship.  
It implements a menu-driven program to perform the following matrix operations using user-defined sizes:

## ✔️ Features
- Matrix Addition  
- Matrix Multiplication  
- Matrix Transpose (for Matrix A and Matrix B)  
- Display Matrix A and Matrix B  
- Fully menu-driven  
- Uses functions and 2D arrays for modularity  
- Supports matrix sizes up to 10×10  

---

## 📌 Concepts Used
- 2D Arrays  
- Functions in C  
- Nested loops  
- Matrix manipulation  
- Input validation  
- Modular programming  

---

## 🧮 Matrix Rules Used
- **Addition**: Possible only if dimensions match (A rows = B rows, A columns = B columns).  
- **Multiplication**: Possible only if `columns of A = rows of B`.  
- **Transpose**: Converts an `r × c` matrix into a `c × r` matrix.
